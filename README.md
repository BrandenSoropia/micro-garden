# 🌳 micro-garden

Develop and grow your own garden without the hassles of being outside!

🏆 MVP: Grow plants over time and on click.

## 📄 Local Setup Instructions

> Must have at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. On my machine, this project is being developed using `v11.2.0`. If you need help managing node versions, try [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)!

1. Clone repo to your machine. Navigate to local copy's location in your Terminal
2. Run either `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
3. All set! Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start serving on `http://localhost:3000/`

## 🥅 Goals

1. Make a game!
2. Practice problem solving and architecting codebase
3. Optional: Learn new technology, maybe React Hooks?!

## 🤔 Nice to Haves: (In order of complexity)

1. I'd like to use React-Intl, not because I want translations (but it does offer easy integrations for that!), but I like having one place for all strings. It makes finding and updating them really easy IMO!
2. Save game state. Not sure how I'd do it exactly, but storing and reading from local storage seems like a nice place to start. If in incognito or some clears their cache often, well, then another more safe method needs to be used (probably a small backend server!)
3. A backend to send game data, like initial state, as well as save user game state. This is a super nice to have. An extreme for this would be for it to send assets as well! Apparently GCloud might be something to look into for this???

## 🗺 Makeshift Roadmap

Trying to define specs and details as much as possible! Then prioritizing!
