#### Don't Use `class`es please!

So it turns out classes aren't serializable, thus if you're using them to manage state, React won't catch them updating! On top of that, it surfaced the issue of figuring out how to update Redux as well when plants progress! I found this out when my Plant's `onClick` would update the class instance's state, but React would not rerender with the new data.

My idea of using `class`es was rooted in the hopes of being able to easily add new plant types in the future that would have the same data format and behaviour, thus making a hopefully seamless integration into the app. Now that this won't work out and after some digging, [I've found that factories are exactly what I'm looking for](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36330732)! They will provide the reusability I'll need as well as support React's state checking! And due to fleshing out updating the class, I can easily move the logic to Redux in a reducer and solve that problem at the same time!

Even though the time and work on developing the class is going to the trash, it left useful insights and recyclable pieces to build a better solution!

#### Above initial state and fetching data:

I'd like to differentiate when there is no data at first versus receiving
no data. For example, when the game initializes, I want the initial state to set `plants` as `null`, indicating the game hasn't fetched the game data yet. After fetching, I'll ideally know to send an empty array, string etc, to mark that a fetch has completed and the game has been "updated".

#### About removing `recompose`:

Hooks are a quicker, neater, more reusable and more easily testable.

#### About PropTypes:

Decided to keep props bundled into objects instead of passing each piece of data individually. I think having component `propTypes` helps clear up what exactly is in these objects and declutters component code.

**Note to self: Maybe write a better "lessons learned" post about classes!**

I'm actually really thankful for giving TypeScript a shot! Even though it was a lot of bashing my head against the wall, it exposed me to the state management necessary for tracking plant state! I realized I knew what data was needed but never thought how the data would be accessed or updated!

I was able to decide on a simple structure for a plant registry that _hopefully_ makes it clear on what's in the state as well as flagging down where all this data lives! (Docs and code in `plants.constants.js`).

üè´ Putting my degree to work:

Now that I've got the basic structure down, I'm realizing that using classes would really be helpful! It would give a clearer blueprint of the "plant" object as well as provide easy access to getters/setters and any other useful functions I'd like to have! Why do I bring this up? Well my initial idea was to have helper functions handle things like incrementing plant development progress, but having the blueprint in one file and then the updating functions in another, I felt it would complicate the connection these two share! On top of that, my plant registry can become a huge dictionary with similar templates between plants. Implementing plant classes, I would be able to create a simple boiler-plate for new plants that would make it easy to create new plant types. In addition, if I were to add any new fields/methods, it would automatically be available to all instances for free! Lastly, a more specific example: how would I get plant sprites once a plant's data is passed to a component? I could write a helper function in the UI code to extract that info based on the plant's current progress and thresholds, but it doesn't make sense to root that in UI logic. It would be better off packaged with a plant class!

Pt II:

Getting a lot of foundation data stuff done! It's good to see exactly how I can get data and update data, but the logic behind them is a little complex. For that reason I spent a bunch of time writing tests to get some more confidence that they actually work! üòÖ It does add a bit more overhead to getting this project going but the extra could pay back in multiples when this gets more complicated by notifying me when things break! Already seeing a bunch of green check marks is a nice confidence boost too!

### Feb 16, 2019

I wanted to learn TypeScript, which seemed to have gone smoothly up until all my dependencies needed to also support it. It became too frustrating and complicated to define types for things like `createStructoredSelector` from `reselect` and `combineReducers` from `redux`. So in order to get this project up off the floor, I decided to cut TypeScript out and decrease the goals of this side project.

Here's what I'm deciding to do this time:

1. Build a game
2. Practice problem solving and architecting
3. Optional: Learn a new technology. A maybe easy contender is React Hooks?

I feel now that with reduced overhead I can now start working towards my goal!
