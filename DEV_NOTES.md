# Dev Notes

Documenting progress, thoughts, lessons, shortcomings etc...

### Feb 16, 2019

I wanted to learn TypeScript, which seemed to have gone smoothly up until all my dependencies needed to also support it. It became too frustrating and complicated to define types for things like `createStructoredSelector` from `reselect` and `combineReducers` from `redux`. So in order to get this project up off the floor, I decided to cut TypeScript out and decrease the goals of this side project.

Here's what I'm deciding to do this time:

1. Build a game
2. Practice problem solving and architecting
3. Optional: Learn a new technology. A maybe easy contender is React Hooks?

I feel now that with reduced overhead I can now start working towards my goal!
